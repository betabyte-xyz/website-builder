                <p>Betabyte lives to code. Building apps in order to just cash out isn’t our style. We care about your app as much as you do. It should be a joy to use and shouldn’t just be eye candy. Let’s make sure that it actually tackles the problems it is trying to solve, shall we?</p>

                <p><strong>Plan. Code. Ship. Repeat.</strong></p>
                <p>We work in sprints consisting of two week iterations starting from the smallest and most essential components of your app. New features and components will be added and shipped every fortnight until you think the app is done. And we’ll never ship anything that’s half-assed.</p>

                <p>No drama. No risky long-term contracts. You have us for a whole sprint. If you’re not happy with what we’ve built then you can tell us tell us to forget about the next sprint.</p>
